Q1) What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A1) ".gitignore" file tells git to ignore the specific files and folders present in it.
For a project based on Java it should include following data:

*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

# virtual machine crash logs, see http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xml

# Eclipse
.settings/
.factorypath
*.tmp
*.bak
*.swp
*~.nib
bin/

.loadpath

Q2) What does fast-forward in git mean?
A2) When a person tries to merge a given commit with the commit that can be done by following by the intial commit's history, git simplifies this by moving the head pointer forward without creating an extra merge commit because there is no divergent work to merge together â€“ this is called a "fast-forward."

Q3) Why should you have different branches? 
A3) For multiple persons working on the same file or feature, separate branches are needed. Also, the master/main branch consists of the verified code. Hence, a person should not ideally test new code int it. As a result, branches should be used to build experimental features that may or may not succeed.

Q4) In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
A4) Preferrably we have 1 repository for a project. But one can have as many as one requires or want.
